# Learn Save All Course Notes

Learn Save All Course Notes will download all course notes from a current enrolled class on UWaterloo's Learn, a web-based learning management system.  

This program was developed when the "download all" course notes button had issues properly downloading all files. As the download functionally has since returned, the project is left in a mostly completed state with minor formatting, sequential download, and unit testing remaining.
